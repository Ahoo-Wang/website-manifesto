# Production Operation Info (OpenShift)

Deployment is via Redhat's Openshift Online cluster.

### Docker image and deploying

We use the sbt-native plugin to produce a docker image.

`> sbt docker:publishLocal`

**Note**: This defaults to stage (which is not set up currently) - prod should be done from CI, but if really wanted you can set the repository override via an environment variable `export DOCKER_REPOSITORY=registry.pro-us-east-1.openshift.com/reactivemanifesto-website`

Once you have a docker image you can upload it to your openshift registry.  There are a number of ways to do this, so you may need to check your documentation.

Currently that mechanism is to deploy the local image to Lightbend's internal repo.  You will need to make sure that you have access and will require both the username and password (or contact internal-it@lightbend.com).

NOTE: You'll need to install the `oc` CLI, which can be accessed from https://console.pro-us-east-1.openshift.com/console/command-line

First login to `oc`:

`oc login https://api.pro-us-east-1.openshift.com -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD`

and change to the correct project if needed:

`oc project reactivemanifesto-website`

After which you can set up your docker:

`docker login -u USERNAME -p $(oc whoami -t) https://registry.pro-us-east-1.openshift.com`

Then push the local image:

`docker push registry.pro-us-east-1.openshift.com/reactivemanifesto-website/reactivemanifesto-website:latest`

### Openshift Setup

In case it needs re-built, the YAML files are in the deploy folder:

* reactivemanifesto-deployment.yaml
* reactivemanifesto-imagestream.yaml
* https-reactivemanifesto-route.yaml
* https-www-reactivemanifesto-route.yaml
* reactivemanifesto-website-service.yaml

You can choose to run these scripts via your `oc` cli or simply upload them into the openshift UI under their respective headings.
Note: with oc you will need to first `oc login`

ie. `oc apply -f deployment/reactivemanifesto-deployment.yaml` (repeat for each yaml)

Secrets are managed through the openshift > secrets UI and are linked via the deployment.yaml
